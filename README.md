Executable: main.js

Small script that checks an array of numbers that represent a credit card number.

Script uses Luhn's algorithm to perform multiple functions with the credit card number.

The script can:
 - Check validity of a single credit card.
 - Check the validity of mulitple credit cards at one time, this is seen with the batch array.
 - Check the credit card company based on the number in index 0 of the credit card array.
 - Modify a invalid credit card to create a valid credit card.
